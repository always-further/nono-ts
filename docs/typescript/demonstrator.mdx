description: "End-to-end sandboxed file transformer demo for nono-ts"
---

This demonstrator provides a full runnable workflow that applies a sandbox, transforms files, and optionally attempts forbidden reads.

The implementation lives at:

- `demo/sandboxed-file-transformer/index.js`

## Run Commands

From the repository root:

```bash
# Build local native addon once per platform
npm run build:debug

# Show capabilities and decisions without applying the sandbox
npm run demo:dry-run

# Apply sandbox and run file transformation
npm run demo

# Apply sandbox, transform files, then run attack checks
npm run demo:attack-test
```

## What It Demonstrates

1. **Least privilege**
- Read-only access to an ephemeral temp input directory
- Read+write access to an ephemeral temp output directory
- Optional `--offline` network blocking mode

2. **Preflight visibility**
- Uses `QueryContext` to print allowed/denied decisions before sandbox application

3. **Runtime enforcement**
- With `NONO_APPLY=1`, calls `apply(caps)` and performs only allowed transformations

4. **Security checks**
- Optional attack mode tries forbidden reads and reports pass/fail outcomes

## Safety Notes

- `apply(caps)` is irreversible for the process lifetime.
- The demo runs in a dedicated process via npm scripts to keep your shell session unaffected.
- The demo writes runtime files to the system temp directory, not the repository tree.
- Attack checks may be marked `INCONCLUSIVE` when target files do not exist on the host.
